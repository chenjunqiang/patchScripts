Collection of scripts I use to manage OpenPDroid source patches and create Autopatcher patches.

Many of these are horrible horrible hacks, and only useful in a file system set up like mine. I believe that manyh of them could be adapted to another person's setup simply by changing the location variables, but that is not true of them all.

I mostly am putting them up on Github to preserve them for my own use in case of disaster, and for others to perhaps adapt and maintain if said disaster is severe enough (heaven forbid, I have children!).
